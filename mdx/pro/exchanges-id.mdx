  ### Note

  - The exchange volume in the response is provided in BTC. To convert it to other currencies, please use [/exchange\_rates](/reference/exchange-rates) endpoint.
  - For derivatives (e.g. `bitmex`, `binance_futures`), to get derivatives exchanges data, please go to [/derivatives/exchange/\{id}](/reference/derivatives-exchanges-id) endpoint.
  - Tickers are limited to 100 items, to get more tickers, please go to [/exchanges/\{id}/tickers](/reference/exchanges-id-tickers) endpoint.
  - When `dex_pair_format=symbol`, the DEX pair `base` and `target` are displayed in symbol format (e.g. `WETH`, `USDC`) instead of as contract addresses.
