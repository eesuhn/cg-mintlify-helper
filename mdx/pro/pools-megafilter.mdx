  ### Tips

  - Using `checks` param to filter pools based on various checks:
    - `checks=no_honeypot` â€” Filter out Honeypot pools, using GoPlus Token Security and De.Fi Scanner.
    - `checks=good_gt_score` â€” Show only pools with a GT Score of at least 75.
    - `checks=on_coingecko` â€” Show only pools with tokens that are listed on CoinGecko.
    - `checks=has_social` â€” Show only pools with their social links and token information updated.
  - You may include values such as `page` to specify which page of responses you would like to show.

  ### Note

  - `dexes` param can only be used when **only 1`networks`** is specified.
  - If the token's market cap is not verified by the team, the API response will return `null` for its market cap value, even though it has a displayed value on GeckoTerminal, which might not be accurate as it often matches the Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV).
  - Attributes specified in the `include` param will be returned under the top-level "included" key.
  - This endpoint returns up to 20 pools per page. Use the `page` param to navigate more results.
  - Setting `include_unknown_honeypot_tokens=true` will include tokens with an 'unknown' honeypot status.
    - Please note that this param only takes effect when `checks=no_honeypot` is specified.
  - Cache/Update frequency: every 30 seconds.
