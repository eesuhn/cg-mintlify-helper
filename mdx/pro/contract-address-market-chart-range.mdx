  ### Tips

  - You may obtain the asset platform and contract address via several ways:
    - refers to respective coin page and find 'contract address'.
    - refers to [`/coins/list`](<https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/coins-list>) endpoint (`include platform = true`).
  - Supports ISO date strings (`YYYY-MM-DD` or\
    `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM`, recommended for best compatibility) or UNIX timestamps.

  ### Note

  - You may leave the interval params as empty for automatic granularity:
    - 1 day from current time = **5-minutely** data
    - 1 day from any time (except current time) = **hourly** data
    - 2 - 90 days from any time = **hourly** data
    - above 90 days from any time = **daily** data (00:00 UTC)
  - For **non-Enterprise plan subscribers** who would like to get hourly data, please leave the interval params empty for auto granularity.
  - The **5-minutely** and **hourly** interval params are also exclusively available to **Enterprise plan subscribers**, bypassing auto-granularity:
    - `interval=5m`: 5-minutely historical data (responses include information from the past 10 days, up until now)
    - `interval=hourly`: hourly historical dataâ€¨(responses include information from the past 100 days, up until now)
  - Data availability:
    - `interval=5m`: Available from 9 February 2018 onwards
    - `interval=hourly`: Available from 30 Jan 2018 onwards
  - Cache / Update Frequency:\
    Based on days range (all the API plans)
    - 1 day = 30 seconds cache
    - 2 -90 days = 30 minutes cache
    - 90 days = 12 hours cache
    - The last completed UTC day (00:00) is available 35 minutes after midnight on the next UTC day (00:35). The cache will always expire at 00:40 UTC
