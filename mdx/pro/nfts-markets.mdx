  - Some collection with low liquidity may not be ranked by Market Cap value, learn more [here](https://support.coingecko.com/hc/en-us/articles/37226121227545-What-is-NFT-Market-Cap). Sorting by Mcap ranking will first prioritise Market Cap value of liquid NFT collections, then followed by trading volume of illiquid NFT collections.
