  ### Note

  - This endpoint includes the newly created pools in the past 48 hours.
  - If the token's market cap is not verified by the team, the API response will return `null` for its market cap value, even though it has a displayed value on GeckoTerminal, which might not be accurate as it often matches the Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV).
  - Attributes specified in the `include` param will be returned under the top-level "included" key.
  - This endpoint returns up to 20 pools per page. Use the `page` param to navigate more results.
  - `page`: Pagination beyond 10 pages is available for [Paid Plan](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/pricing) subscribers (Analyst plan or above).
  - Cache/Update frequency: every 30 seconds.
  - GeckoTerminal equivalent page (example): [https://www.geckoterminal.com/explore/new-crypto-pools/solana](https://www.geckoterminal.com/explore/new-crypto-pools/solana)
