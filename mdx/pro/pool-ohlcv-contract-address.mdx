<Tip>
### Tips
- You may use this endpoint to query the historical price and volume of a token.
- You may select the timeframe with its respective aggregate to get the intended OHLCV data (e.g. `minute?aggregate=15` for 15 minutes OHLCV).

<Note>
### Note
- This endpoint uses epoch/unix format for its timestamp. Example: `1708850449`.
- [Paid plan](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/pricing) subscribers (Analyst plan & above) can access data from **September 2021 to the present**, depending on when the pool started tracking on GeckoTerminal.
  - If no earlier data is available, an empty response will be returned.
  - Each API call can only retrieve data for a **maximum range of 6 months**. To fetch older data, use the `before_timestamp` parameter to query in multiple requests.
- Pools with more than 2 tokens are not yet supported for this endpoint.
- Each OHLCV array (under "ohlcv_list") consists of 6 elements in the following order:
  - Timestamp: The epoch/unix timestamp representing the start of the time interval.
  - Open: The opening price of the asset at the beginning of the interval.
  - High: The highest price reached during the interval.
  - Low: The lowest price reached during the interval.
  - Close: The price of the asset at the end of the interval.
  - Volume: The total trading volume of the asset during the interval.
- **Skipped Intervals**: To ensure concise and relevant data, specific timeframe intervals (e.g. minutely) with no recorded swaps are **excluded** from the response.
  - Higher granularity timeframes (e.g. 1 minute) are more likely to skip intervals due to periods of inactivity, while lower granularity timeframes (e.g. daily) are less affected.
- For `include_empty_intervals` param:
  - When `false` (default): Only intervals with trade data are returned.
  - When `true`: All requested intervals are returned, those with no trade data are populated as follows:
    - OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) are all set to the Close price of the previous interval.
      - *O = H = L = C = previous Close*
    - Volume (V) is set to 0, reflecting no trade activity.
- Cache/Update frequency: every 30 seconds.
