  ### Tips

  - If you would like to query token data such as decimals, total supply, price and etc. You can go to this endpoint [`/networks/{network}/tokens/{address}`](<https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/token-data-contract-address>) instead.
  - Cache/Update frequency: every 60 seconds.
  - Learn more about GT score [here](https://support.coingecko.com/hc/en-us/articles/38381394237593-What-is-GT-Score-How-is-GT-Score-calculated).
  - Metadata (image, websites, description, socials) may be sourced on-chain and is not vetted by the CoinGecko team. If you wish to get metadata reviewed by CoinGecko team, you may use the following endpoints:
    - [Coin Data by ID](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/coins-id)
    - [Coin Data by Token Address](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/coins-contract-address)
