### Tips
- You may obtain the asset platform and contract address via several ways:
  - refers to respective coin page and find 'contract address'.
  - refers to [`/coins/list`](<https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/coins-list>) endpoint (`include platform = true`).
- You may flag to include more data such as market cap, 24hr volume, 24hr change, last updated time etc.
