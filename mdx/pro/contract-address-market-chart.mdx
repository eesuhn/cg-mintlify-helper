### Tips
- You may obtain the asset platform and contract address via several ways:
  - refers to respective coin page and find 'contract address'.
  - refers to [`/coins/list`](<https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/coins-list>) endpoint (`include platform = true`).
</Tip>

<Note>
### Note
- You may leave the interval params as empty for automatic granularity:
  - 1 day from current time = **5-minutely** data
  - 2 - 90 days from current time = **hourly** data
  - above 90 days from current time = **daily** data (00:00 UTC)
- For **non-Enterprise plan subscribers** who would like to get hourly data, please leave the interval params empty for auto granularity.
- The **5-minutely** and **hourly** interval params are also exclusively available to **Enterprise plan subscribers,** bypassing auto-granularity:
  - `interval=5m`: 5-minutely historical data (responses include information from the past 10 days up until now)
  - `interval=hourly`: hourly historical dataâ€¨(responses include information from the past 100 days, up until now)
- Cache / Update Frequency:  
  - Every 5 minutes for all the API plans.
  - The last completed UTC day (00:00) is available 35 minutes after midnight on the next UTC day (00:35). The cache will always expire at 00:40 UTC.
