<Tip>
### Tips
- You may include values such as `page` to specify which page of responses you would like to show.
- For more flexibility in retrieving an exact list of pools that match your specific needs, consider using the [/pools/megafilter](/reference/pools-megafilter) endpoint.

<Note>
### Note
- Trending rankings are determined by a combination of factors:
  - User engagement on geckoterminal.com
  - Market activity, such as trading volume and transactions
  - Pool security and credibility, including liquidity and honeypot checks
- If the token's market cap is not verified by the team, the API response will return `null` for its market cap value, even though it has a displayed value on GeckoTerminal, which might not be accurate as it often matches the Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV).
- Attributes specified in the `include` param will be returned under the top-level "included" key.
- This endpoint returns up to 20 pools per page. Use the `page` param to navigate more results.
- `page`: Pagination beyond 10 pages is available for [Paid Plan](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/pricing) subscribers (Analyst plan or above).
- Cache/Update frequency: every 30 seconds.
- GeckoTerminal equivalent page (example): [https://www.geckoterminal.com](https://www.geckoterminal.com)
