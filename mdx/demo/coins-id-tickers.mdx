<Tip>
  ### Tips

  - You may obtain the coin ID (API ID) via several ways:
    - refers to respective coin page and find 'API ID'.
    - refers to [`/coins/list`](<https://docs.coingecko.com/v3.0.1/reference/coins-list>) endpoint.
    - refers to google sheets [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wTTuxXt8n9q7C4NDXqQpI3wpKu1_5bGVmP9Xz0XGSyU/edit?usp=sharing).
  - You may specify the `exchange_ids` if you want to retrieve tickers for specific exchange only.
  - You may include values such as  `page` to specify which page of responses you would like to show.
  - You may also flag to include more data such as exchange logo and depth.

<Note>
  ### Note

  - The tickers are paginated to 100 items.
  - When `dex_pair_format=symbol`, the DEX pair `base` and `target` are displayed in symbol format (e.g. `WETH`, `USDC`) instead of as contract addresses.
  - When order is sorted by `volume`, ***converted\_volume*** will be used instead of ***volume***.
  - Cache / Update Frequency: every 2 minutes for all the API plans.
