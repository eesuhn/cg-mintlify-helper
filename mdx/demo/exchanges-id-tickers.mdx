<Note>
  ### Note

  - Responses are paginated and limited to 100 tickers per page. You may specify the page number using the `page` params to retrieve the tickers accordingly.
  - `order=base_target` sorts tickers by `base` symbol, then `target` symbol, in lexicographical order (`0 -> 9`, followed by `a -> z`).\
    This sorting method ensures stable pagination results, minimizing cases where cached responses might otherwise cause duplicate or missing tickers across paginated pages.
  - When `dex_pair_format=symbol`, the DEX pair `base` and `target` are displayed in symbol format (e.g. `WETH`, `USDC`) instead of as contract addresses.
  - Cache / Update Frequency: every 60 seconds for all the API plans.
