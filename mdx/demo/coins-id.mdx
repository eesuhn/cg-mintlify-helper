  ### Tips

  - You may obtain the coin `id` (API ID) via several ways:
    - refers to respective coin page and find "API ID".
    - refers to [`/coins/list`](<https://docs.coingecko.com/v3.0.1/reference/coins-list>) endpoint.
    - refers to Google Sheets [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wTTuxXt8n9q7C4NDXqQpI3wpKu1_5bGVmP9Xz0XGSyU/edit?usp=sharing).
  - You may also flag to include more data such as tickers, market data, community data, developer data and sparkline.
  - You may refer to `last_updated` in the endpoint response to check whether the price is stale.
</Tip>

<Note>
  ### Note

  - Tickers are limited to 100 items, to get more tickers, please go to [/coins/\{id}/tickers](/reference/coins-id-tickers).
  - Coin descriptions may include newline characters represented as `\r\n` (escape sequences), which may require processing for proper formatting.
  - When `dex_pair_format=symbol`, the DEX pair `base` and `target` are displayed in symbol format (e.g. `WETH`, `USDC`) instead of as contract addresses.
  - Cache/Update Frequency:
    - Every 60 seconds for all the API plans.
    - Community data for Telegram will be updated on weekly basis (Reddit & Twitter community data are no longer supported).
