  ### Tips

  - You may obtain the asset platform and contract address via several ways:
    - refers to respective coin page and find 'contract address'.
    - refers to [`/coins/list`](<https://docs.coingecko.com/v3.0.1/reference/coins-list>) endpoint (`include platform = true`).
  - You may flag to include more data such as market cap, 24hr volume, 24hr change, last updated time etc.
