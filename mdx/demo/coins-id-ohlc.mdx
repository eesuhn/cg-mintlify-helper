  ### Tips

  - You may obtain the coin ID (API ID) via several ways:
    - refers to respective coin page and find 'API ID'.
    - refers to [`/coins/list`](<https://docs.coingecko.com/v3.0.1/reference/coins-list>) endpoint.
    - refers to google sheets [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wTTuxXt8n9q7C4NDXqQpI3wpKu1_5bGVmP9Xz0XGSyU/edit?usp=sharing).
  - For historical chart data with better granularity, you may consider using [/coins/\{id}/market\_chart](/reference/coins-id-market-chart) endpoint.
