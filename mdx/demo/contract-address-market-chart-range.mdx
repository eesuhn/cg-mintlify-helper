  ### Tips

  - You may obtain the asset platform and contract address via several ways:
    - refers to respective coin page and find 'contract address'.
    - refers to [`/coins/list`](<https://docs.coingecko.com/v3.0.1/reference/coins-list>) endpoint (`include platform = true`).

  ### Note

  - You may leave the interval params as empty for automatic granularity:
    - 1 day from current time = **5-minutely** data
    - 1 day from any time (except current time) = **hourly** data
    - 2 - 90 days from any time = **hourly** data
    - above 90 days from any time = **daily** data (00:00 UTC)
  - Cache / Update Frequency:\
    Based on days range (all the API plans)
    - 1 day = 30 seconds cache
    - 2 -90 days = 30 minutes cache
    - 90 days = 12 hours cache
  - The last completed UTC day (00:00) is available 35 minutes after midnight on the next UTC day (00:35). The cache will always expire at 00:40 UTC.
  - Access to historical data via the Public API (Demo plan) is **restricted to the past 365 days** only. To access the complete range of historical data, please subscribe to one of our [paid plans](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/pricing) to obtain a Pro-API key.
