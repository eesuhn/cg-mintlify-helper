  ### Tips

  - You can retrieve specific coins using their unique `ids`, `names`, or `symbols` instead of returning the whole list.
  - To filter results based on the coin's category, use the `category` param (refer to [`/coins/categories/list`](<https://docs.coingecko.com/v3.0.1/reference/coins-categories-list>) for available categories).
  - Use the `per_page` and `page` params to manage the number of results you receive and navigate through the data.

<Note>
  ### Note

  - When multiple lookup params are provided, the following priority order is applied: `category` (highest) > `ids` > `names` > `symbols` (lowest).
  - When searching by `name`, you need to URL-encode any spaces (e.g. "Binance Coin" becomes "Binance%20Coin").
  - The `include_tokens=all` param is exclusively for use with the `symbols` lookup and is limited to maximum of 50 symbols per request.
  - Wildcard searches are not supported for lookup params (`ids`, `names`, `symbols`).
  - Cache/Update Frequency:
    - Every 60 seconds for Public API.
    - Every 45 seconds for Pro API (Analyst, Lite, Pro, Enterprise).
