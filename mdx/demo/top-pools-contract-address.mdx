  ### Note

  - The ranking of the top 20 pools is established by evaluating their liquidity and trading activity to identify the most liquid ones. This ranking is determined through a combination of two key factors: liquidity (`reserve_in_usd`) and 24-Hour Trading Volume (`volume_usd`).
  - If the token's market cap is not verified by the team, the API response will return `null` for its market cap value, even though it has a displayed value on GeckoTerminal, which might not be accurate as it often matches the Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV).
  - Attributes specified in the `include` param will be returned under the top-level "included" key.
  - This endpoint returns up to 20 pools per page. Use the `page` param to navigate more results.
  - `page`: Pagination beyond 10 pages is available for [Paid Plan](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/pricing) subscribers (Analyst plan or above).
  - Cache/Update frequency: every 60 seconds.
